# School of English Galway

This is a website of an imaginary English Language School based in Galway, Ireland that I create for **Milestone Project 1, Full Stack Software Development in Code Institute**.

## Who's this website for?

People whose first language is <ins>NOT</ins> English and who are looking for a school to improve their English level for various purposes, as well as who would like to have some experiences living in a foreign country while they study English. They could be from anywhere in the world so some might know about Galway / Ireland quite well and some might not. User's goals are to be able to find out core information about the school, such as location, courses, accommodation, prices and feedback from the former students in order to make up their mind, and to be able to contact the school or make a booking without any difficulties if they wish to do so.

## Who is the owner?

The owner of the language school. Owner's goals are to increase the number of direct students (direct sales) as currently a lot of students come from agents that they work with.

## UX 5 Planes

### Strategy Plane

As users are non-native English speakers, **keeping the website simple** is essential and **using more visual contents** than text contents would help them to understand the information easily. It targets business-to-consumer (B2C) so all the information must be clear and well presented.

The main aims for this website are;

- To provide users enough information about the school
- To provide users easy access to a booking process

Below tables show what should be included on the website to make the website valuable to the users. I would like to implement all of them in the website, however `Different Languages` and `Quotation Calculator` are not implemented due to lack of my current skills.

### Structure Plane

The website consists of 4 pages (Home, Course, Accommodation, Register) and everything is laid out logically so that users can easily predict and learn about the website.

**`Home page`**

There is a hero image with school's catch phrase **"Go west... to learn English, make friends and have fun!"**.
There are brief course descriptions, brief accommodation descriptions and feedback underneath hero image.

**`Courses`**

Outlining the details of each course with a link to the price list. There are image galleries of the courses. Same layout as Accommodation.

### Surface Plane

#### Colour

**Dark Green (#065446)** is the school colour so this colour is used for header and footer. Background colour is white and gold is used for buttons. Irish flag is imaged for colour coordinations.

#### Typography

**Serif** type (Noto Serif) is used for headings to make the website trustful as this is for education. On the other hand, **San-Serif** type (Open Sans) is used for contents to make the website easy to read and give friendly atmosphere to the users.
