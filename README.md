Responsive Mockup

User Stories
This is a website of an imaginary English Language School based in Galway, Ireland.

User: People whose first language is not English and who are looking for a school to improve their English level for various purposes, as well as who would like to have some experiences living in a foreign country while they study English. They could be from anywhere in the world so some might know about Galway / Ireland quite well and some might not.

User's goals: To be able to find out core information about the school, such as location, courses, accommodation, prices and feedback from the former students in order to make up their mind. To be able to contact the school or make a booking without any difficulties if they wish to do so. 

Owner: The owner of the language school.

Owner's goals: To increase the number of direct students (direct sales) as currently a lot of students come from agents that they work with. 

5 Planes
  Strategy Plane
    Users are non-native English speakers so keeping the website simple is essential and using more visual contents than text contents would help them to understand the information.
    It targets business-to-consumer (B2C) so all the information must be clear.
    
    Aim for this website is;
     to provide users enough information about the school.
     to provide users easy access to a booking process.
